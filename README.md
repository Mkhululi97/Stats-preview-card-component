## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to give equal spaces for margin bottom and margin top, I also learned to change an images color with the use of CSS.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  -webkit-filter: opacity(0.4) drop-shadow(0 0 0 hsl(277, 64%, 61%));
}
```

### Continued development

I'm not comfortable with changing images color with css, and spacing elements, getting letter spacing and line heights, setting up the font sizes accordingly, to match the design as close as possible, I find that to be challenging.

### Useful resources

- [fit-content()(grid) resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content_function) - This helped me for making the grid cell fit the content inside it. This is such a neat solution for grid rows or columns that take up more space than needed, which can affect things such as padding or margins.
- [equal top and bottom padding resource 2](https://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/demo/vertical-centering/padding.php#:~:text=Equal%20top%20and%20bottom%20paddings,both%20divs%20to%20grow%20dynamically.) - This helped me get unstuck on, how to get equal spaces for top and bottom margins/paddings.
